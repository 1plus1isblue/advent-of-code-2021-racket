# notes
Goal is to sum up all version numbers in all packets in the hierarchy. I don't actually need to do anything other than figure out version numbers and how to traverse the hierarchy.

# TODOs
* [I] read literal outputs struct
* [ ] convert examples into tests that output sum of version numbers
  * [ ] test for embedded packets
  * [ ] test for recursively embedded packets?
